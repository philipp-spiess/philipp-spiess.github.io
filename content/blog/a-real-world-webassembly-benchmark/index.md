In late 2016, we released the first version of our Web SDK, which relies on a server component to render documents. Only a few months later, we released an updated version of PSPDFKit for Web — one that doesn’t require a server component and instead uses WebAssembly (Wasm, WA) to render documents directly in the browser. This was a big achievement for us as a company, and being able to provide a browser-only solution that doesn’t require any backend infrastructure lowers the barrier to entry for our customers.
