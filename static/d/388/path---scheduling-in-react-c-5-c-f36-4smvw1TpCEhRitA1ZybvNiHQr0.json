The button might show a modal, the input field will display the key that was typed.</li>\n<li><strong>Interactions can happen at any time.</strong> Since we all can’t predict the future, we don’t know if a user will click a button in 10 milliseconds or in 5 seconds. In order to react to interactions as soon as possible, we need to stay responsive to browser events.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To visualize the problems, let’s take a look at the demo application that Dan Abramov showed us at his talk <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html\">Beyond React 16</a> at JSConf Iceland 2018. The more you type into the input box above, the more detailed the charts below will get. Since both of those updates run at the same time, the input feels janky.</p>\n<p><video src=\"/blog/scheduling-in-react/sync-mode.mp4\" muted=\"true\" autoplay loop></video></p>\n<p>One thing that we can see in the example above is that it’s more important to update the text box with the user input than it is to update the carts. A version that prioritizes that will appear a lot more responsive to the end user.</p>\n<p><video src=\"/blog/scheduling-in-react/concurrent-mode.mp4\" muted=\"true\" autoplay loop></video></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, current user interface architectures makes it non trivial to implement this kind of prioritization. One way to solve this is by <a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function\">debouncing</a> the chart update. The problem with this is that the charts still render in one go synchronously when the debounced callback fires, which will again cause our user interface to take multiple seconds during which it is not responsive. We can do better!</p>\n<h3>Browser Event Loop</h3>\n<p>Before we learn more about concrete solutions, let’s dig deeper and understand why the browser has issues these kind of user interfaces.</p>\n<p>Most JavaScript code is executed on the same thread that is also responsible for other document lifecycles like layout and paint<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup>. This means that whenever your JavaScript code runs, the browser is blocked form doing anything else.</p>\n<p><span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 26.47754137115839%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"The browser event loop starts by running input handlers, followed by animation frame callbacks, and ends with document lifecycles (style, layout, paint).
